## by (Mohamed Abdullah)


## Dataset

> Ford GoBike (also known as Bay Wheels system) is a regional public bicycle sharing system in California's San Francisco Bay Area and was introduced in 2013 as a pilot program for the region, with 700 bikes and 70 stations across San Francisco and San Jose.
> The bikes are available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year and riders have access to all bikes in the network when they become a member or purchase a pass.
> Ford GoBike consists of a fleet of specially designed, environment-friendly and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips.
> This document explores the Ford GoBike's trip data for public containing bike rides from February 2019.
